# Raspberry Pi Oracle Weather Station

## Installation

Follow the guides and tutorials at [https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/weather\_station\_guide](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/weather_station_guide) (published at [www.raspberrypi.org/weather-station](https://www.raspberrypi.org/weather-station/))

## Version

This repo contains the updated version of the software, re-engineered for the [Stretch version of Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-stretch/). If you are an existing Weather Station owner and are using a Pi running the Jessie version of Raspbian, then this code will not work without modification. You should update your SD card with the [latest Raspbian image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and perform a fresh install (you may wish to take a copy of your local MYSQL database first).
